**Prompt for Designing a Student LMS Mock Test Interface**

**Objective:** Create a user-friendly mock test interface for a Learning Management System (LMS) that allows students to navigate through various test options and access their desired exam materials efficiently.

**Instructions for AI Response:**

1. **Main Menu Design:**
   - Create an initial menu with options: 
     - Previous Year Papers
     - Full-Length Tests
     - Sessional Tests
     - Module Tests
   - Each option should be represented by a button.

2. **Sub-Menu for Previous Year Papers:**
   - Upon clicking "Previous Year Papers," generate two additional buttons:
     - Paper Wise
     - Topic Wise

3. **Paper Wise Option:**
   - When "Paper Wise" is selected, display a dropdown menu containing the following exams:
     - CAT
     - SNAP
     - XAT
     - XSAT
   - Ensure that this dropdown is populated dynamically by the admin.

4. **Topic Wise Option:**
   - When "Topic Wise" is selected, provide a dropdown menu with the following topics:
     - Verbal
     - LRDI (Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation)
     - Quantitative Aptitude
   - Allow the admin to customize the topics listed here.

5. **Sub-Topics for Each Main Topic:**
   - When a main topic is selected (e.g., Verbal), create a further dropdown for sub-topics such as:
     - Geometry
     - Reading Comprehension (RC)
   - Ensure that these sub-topics can be added or modified by the admin as needed.

6. **Full-Length Tests Section:**
   - In the "Full-Length Tests" menu, include options for:
     - CAT
     - XAT
     - SNAP
   - Allow the admin to add any other relevant full-length tests.

7. **Test Declaration:**
   - After a test is selected, display a declaration message that students must acknowledge before proceeding.

8. **Test Interface Style:**
   - Once the declaration is accepted, the interface should transition to a mock test format styled like CAT (Common Admission Test), providing a realistic exam experience.

9. **User Experience Considerations:**
   - Ensure that navigation between menus and sub-menus is intuitive and easy to follow.
   - Include visual elements such as buttons, dropdowns, and confirmation messages to enhance usability.

10. **Admin Control:**
   - Specify that all elements (subjects, topics, sub-topics) are manageable by the admin through a backend interface.
